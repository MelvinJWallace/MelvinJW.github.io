						<h1>Melvin Wallace<br />
						Data Analyst</h1>
						<p>I am a very meticulous data analyst who is passionate about everything tech and data related. Throughout my
							ever learning journey of exploring and finding insights within data, the true enjoyment are the challenges and
							processes that are involved in gathering, cleaning, proccessing, analyzing, and visualizing data.
							The tools that I use for analyzing and visualizing data vary depending on the project. However, I am
							well versed in Excel, MS SQL, MS PowerBI, as well as Python</a>.</p>

								<h2><a href="https://github.com/MelvinJWallace/PortfolioProjects/blob/main/OnlineSalesDataPyProject.ipynb">Hospital Patient Records Project (Python)<br />
								</a></h2>
								<p>In this project I will be playing the role of an Analytics Consultant for Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH). I have been asked to build a high-level KPI report for the executive team, based on a subset of patient records.
									The purpose of the report is to give stakeholders visibility into the hospital's recent performance, and answer the business questions that the CEO inquired about. The CEO has asked me to summarize any insights that I can derive from the 
									sample provided. I will be utilizing Python to perform all data analysis in this project.

									<p>In this project I will find trends and patterns to unlock actionable insights. I will utilize the power of Python and its libraries to clean the dataframe by checking for and removing any duplicate rows
										of data and null values. Then I will transform the dataframe by extracting the month and the day from the data column to get a more in depth look at the data. I will then process the data by calculating
										sums, averages, maximums, and minimum values from the unit sold and unit price columns. Finally, I will answer the business questions about the dataset inquired by the stakeholder.

									<p>In this personal project I will be exploring movie data from the years 2012 to 2016. The data consist of info such as movie title, genre, budget and revenue. 
										I will be cleaning this data and performing exploratory data analysis to look for trends. I will also perform data processing to calculate an additional 'profits' column 
										and demonstrate how to represent those findings visually. The dataset was retrieved from the Kaggle website and is open source. </p>

									<p>This personal project is on a Healthcare Insurance dataset. The dataset was retrieved from the Kaggle website and consists of fictional patient information. In this project I showcase my abilities to clean,
										manipulate, transform, process, analyze, and visualize data in a way that provides insight and answers to potential business related questions.</p>

									<p>This dataset was retrieved from the Kaggle webite and it consist of different fruit and vegetable products from four different retailers based in Atlanta, Chicago, Los Angeles, and New York. The data also has the date, farm price, and the average spread
										for the product. In the SQL project, I demonstrate how to transform and manipulate the date column to extract the year and month to create new columns to be used for calculations. I also find the tital and average sales for the different retailers by 
										month and year. The goal of this project was to answer particular questions and provide insights into the data.
