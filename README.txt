PORTFOLIO WEBSITE

Welcome!

Hello, my name is Melvin Wallace and I would like to introduce you to my personal portfolio website.
Here, you will find some of my favorite projects that I have completed in the past with many future projects to follow in the near future.
I have a collection of projects that were completed in python, sql, and power bi that I will be showcasing to highlight and demonstrate my 
skills and understanding of data analysis while extracting useful and actionable insights from the data utilizing different data tools.
